Disclaimers,"The 2013 List of Polling Districts comes from TindakMalaysia's internal datasets. EC didn't disclose the pre-redelineation figures (referring to the older set of allocation of polling districs). Information of newly created polling districts came from Tindak Malaysia's analysis on the redelineation reports and pre 2015 EC maps. While every effort has been made to ensure accuracy and completeness of the data, TindakMalaysia Network Services PLT is not responsible for errors and omissions arising from the dataset"
